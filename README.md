## 👩🏽‍💻 My Role & Learnings

I built InspireMe from scratch as a way to practice:
- DOM manipulation using arrays and event handling  
- Building a component-style structure without a frontend framework  
- Deploying a static site and iterating on design and function

I especially loved how quickly I could test and improve the quote logic and UI. In future versions, I plan to:
- Replace the static quote array with a **quote API** (e.g., Quotable or They Said So)  
- Add animations and transitions to improve UX  
- Implement local storage for saving favorite quotes
