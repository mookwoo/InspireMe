## My Role & Learnings

I built InspireMe from scratch as a way to practice:
- DOM manipulation using arrays and event handling  
- Building a component-style structure without a frontend framework  
- Deploying a static site and iterating on design and function

I especially loved how quickly I could test and improve the quote logic and UI. In future versions, I plan to:
- Save the array quotes to a database.  
- Implement a favourite quotes feature  
- Implement a social searching button
- Implement a form that allows users to submit quotes.
